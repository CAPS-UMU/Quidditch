# test case utils
- This folder contains extra c code to include in test cases.
- It's copied from here: https://github.com/EmilySillars/Quidditch-zigzag/tree/tiling/runtime/tests/lib-zigzag
- It might not be helpful in any way, but just in case, `zigzag_dispatch.h` includes the `memref.h` from this folder.
